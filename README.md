RayNeo X3 Pro MIT Reality Hack Sample Project

Welcome to the official sample project repository for the RayNeo X3 Pro, specifically designed for developers at MIT Reality Hack 2026. This project serves as a comprehensive foundational template to help you jumpstart your development and explore the unique capabilities of the X3 Pro hardware and SDK.

Created and organized by Max Manausa (Metaverse Max), this repository is intended to help the developer community quickly explore and build for the RayNeo X3 Pro.

🚀 Overview

This repository includes a fully built-out Unity project that demonstrates the core features of the RayNeo X3 Pro SDK. Whether you are building a utility app, a spatial game, or a collaborative tool, this sample provides the boilerplate code and scene setups needed to leverage advanced AR functionalities immediately.

✨ Key Features Demonstrated

The sample project includes implementations of the following SDK capabilities:

Dual Display Rendering: Optimize user experience with priority focus rendering across the X3 Pro's dual-display architecture.

6DoF & 3DoF Tracking: Choose between full spatial freedom (6 Degrees of Freedom) for world-anchored content or rotational tracking (3 Degrees of Freedom) for HUD-style interfaces.

Face Tracking: Leverage integrated sensors to capture and react to facial expressions and positioning.

Scene Detection: Understand the environment with spatial awareness and plane detection.

Gaze Interaction: A hands-free interaction model allowing users to select and interact with UI elements using eye direction.

And More: Explore additional SDK integrations including gesture controls and spatial audio setups.

🛠 Getting Started

Prerequisites

Unity Version: 2022.3.36f1

RayNeo SDK: The necessary SDK packages are included/linked within the project.

Hardware: RayNeo X3 Pro, USBC - USBC cable, windows laptop that can run unity and ADB

Installation

Clone this repository:

Bash

git clone https://github.com/MaxManausa/Metaverse-Max-RayNeo-X3-Pro-Set-Up.git Open the project in Unity.

Follow the instructions from: https://leiniao-ibg.feishu.cn/wiki/IwTRwecN0ikZcjkHAhicN5lWn0g Or you can follow these directions made by me that speed things up I think: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Mo0I4mmjyizU5rbNn7AJm8B9EInUDz-W/edit?slide=id.p1#slide=id.p1

💡 Usage at MIT Reality Hack and for general development

This project is intended to be a "plug-and-play" resource. You are encouraged to:

Fork this repo to use as a base for your hackathon submission.

Strip the sample logic to use the underlying XR configurations.

Reference the scripts to understand how to call specific SDK functions like face tracking or gaze input.

Here's a big hint: each sample scene has one script (sometimes 2) that show off the capability in that specific sample scene. You can duplicate that script and make it whatever you want to leverage that specific capability.

🤝 Contribution & Support

This project is made for the developer community. If you find bugs or have improvements during the hackathon, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.

Created with ⚡ by Max Manausa for the RayNeo developer ecosystem.

Good luck to all hackers at MIT Reality Hack 2026! Let's build the future of XR!
